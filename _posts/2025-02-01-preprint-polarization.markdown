Jinyang's thesis' first manuscript is now out on ([BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.31.635919))!

In this work, Jinyang invistigates how much information the ARG contains regarding ancestral alleles. The result is a new method, called PolarBEAR (Polarization By Estimation of the Ancestral Recombination graph), which can infer ancestral alleles and unfolded site frequency spectra (uSFS) without any outgroup sequence (in exchange of phased data).

We got a brand new Doctor in the lab! 
Jinyang Liang successfully defended his PhD titled “Population Genomic Inference with the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG): Recombination Landscape and Ancestral State Reconstruction” — huge congrats! Also known in the lab as the resident Python debugger, we are very happy he will be sticking around a bit longer!

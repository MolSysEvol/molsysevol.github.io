On July 8th and 9th, together with the [Evolutionary Developmental Dynamics research group](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/evodevodynamics), we hosted a workshop on evolutionary single-cell biology.
Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig participated in this two-day exchange.

The event provided a platform for various research groups to share their expertise in the generation and analysis of single-cell omics data. Topics such as the evolution of new cell types, the assessment of the fitness effects of human-specific mutations, and the origin of phenotypic variation were thoroughly discussed.

The workshop promoted scientific exchange and strengthened the collaboration between the two institutes in the field of evolutionary single-cell biology.

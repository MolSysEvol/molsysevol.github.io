  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is an important driver of evolution. Variability in the intensity of recombination across chromosomes can affect sequence composition, nucleotide variation, and rates of adaptation. In many organisms, recombination events are concentrated within short segments termed recombination hotspots. The variation in recombination rate and positions of recombination hotspot can be studied using population genomics data and statistical methods. In this study, we conducted population genomics analyses to address the evolution of recombination in two closely related fungal plant pathogens: the prominent wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and a sister species infecting wild grasses Z. ardabiliae We specifically addressed whether recombination landscapes, including hotspot positions, are conserved in the two recently diverged species and if recombination contributes to rapid evolution of pathogenicity traits. We conducted a detailed simulation analysis to assess the performance of methods of recombination rate estimation based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium, in particular in the context of high nucleotide diversity. Our analyses reveal overall high recombination rates, a lack of suppressed recombination in centromeres, and significantly lower recombination rates on chromosomes that are known to be accessory. The comparison of the recombination landscapes of the two species reveals a strong correlation of recombination rate at the megabase scale, but little correlation at smaller scales. The recombination landscapes in both pathogen species are dominated by frequent recombination hotspots across the genome including coding regions, suggesting a strong impact of recombination on gene evolution. A significant but small fraction of these hotspots colocalize between the two species, suggesting that hotspot dynamics contribute to the overall pattern of fast evolving recombination in these species.},

  abstract   = {Why the autosomal recombination rate differs between female and male meiosis in most species has been a genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.},

  abstract  = {The variability of gene expression levels, also known as gene expression noise, is an evolvable trait subject to selection. While gene expression noise is detrimental in constant environments where the expression level is under stabilizing selection, it may be beneficial in changing environments when the phenotype is far from the optimum. However, expression noise propagates along the gene network, making the evolution of connected genes interdependent. Here, we explore how their position in the gene network constrains the evolution of genes under selection using an in silico evolution experiment. We simulate the evolution of populations of model gene regulatory networks under directional and fluctuating selection on the gene expression level while allowing the basal expression level and expression noise level to mutate. We find that expression noise is only transiently favoured under directional selection, but high levels of noise can be maintained in a fluctuating selection regime. Furthermore, target genes, regulated by other genes, were more likely to increase their gene-specific expression noise than regulator genes. These findings suggest that both the mean and variance of gene expression levels respond to selection due to changing environments – and do so in a network-dependent manner. They further point at gene expression noise as a putative mechanism for populations to escape extinction when facing environmental changes.},

  abstract   = {Expression noise, the variability of the amount of gene product among isogenic cells grown in identical conditions, originates from the inherent stochasticity of diffusion and binding of the molecular players involved in transcription and translation. It has been shown that expression noise is an evolvable trait and that central genes exhibit less noise than peripheral genes in gene networks. A possible explanation for this pattern is increased selective pressure on central genes since they propagate their noise to downstream targets, leading to noise amplification. To test this hypothesis, we developed a new gene regulatory network model with inheritable stochastic gene expression and simulated the evolution of gene-specific expression noise under constraint at the network level. Stabilizing selection was imposed on the expression level of all genes in the network and rounds of mutation, selection, replication and recombination were performed. We observed that local network features affect both the probability to respond to selection, and the strength of the selective pressure acting on individual genes. In particular, the reduction of gene-specific expression noise as a response to stabilizing selection on the gene expression level is higher in genes with higher centrality metrics. Furthermore, global topological structures such as network diameter, centralization and average degree affect the average expression variance and average selective pressure acting on constituent genes. Our results demonstrate that selection at the network level leads to differential selective pressure at the gene level, and local and global network characteristics are an essential component of gene-specific expression noise evolution.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of species adaptation to their environments has long been a central focus of the study of evolution. Theories of adaptation propose that populations evolve by “walking” in a fitness landscape. This “adaptive walk” is characterised by a pattern of diminishing returns, where populations further away from their fitness optimum take larger steps than those closer to their optimal conditions. Hence, we expect young genes to evolve faster and experience mutations with stronger fitness effects than older genes because they are further away from their fitness optimum. Testing this hypothesis, however, constitutes an arduous task. Young genes are small, encode proteins with a higher degree of intrinsic disorder, are expressed at lower levels, and are involved in species-specific adaptations. Since all these factors lead to increased protein evolutionary rates, they could be masking the effect of gene age. While controlling for these factors, we used population genomic data sets of Arabidopsis and Drosophila and estimated the rate of adaptive substitutions across genes from different phylostrata. We found that a gene’s evolutionary age significantly impacts the molecular rate of adaptation. Moreover, we observed that substitutions in young genes tend to have larger physicochemical effects. Our study, therefore, provides strong evidence that molecular evolution follows an adaptive walk model across a large evolutionary timescale.},

Here, we conduct a population genomic study of domesticated and wild populations of S. cerevisiae. Using coalescent analyses, we report that the effective population size of yeast populations decreased since the divergence with S. paradoxus. We fitted models of distributions of fitness effects to infer the rate of adaptive (wa) and non-adaptive (wna) non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes. We report an overall limited contribution of positive selection to S. cerevisiae protein evolution, albeit with higher rates of adaptive evolution in wild compared to domesticated populations. Our analyses revealed the signature of background selection and possibly Hill-Robertson interference, as recombination was found to be negatively correlated with wna and positively correlated with wa. However, the effect of recombination on wa was found to be labile, as it is only apparent after removing the impact of codon usage bias on the synonymous site frequency spectrum and disappears if we control for the correlation with wna, suggesting that it could be an artefact of the decreasing population size. Furthermore, the rate of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions is significantly correlated with the residue solvent exposure, a relation that cannot be explained by the population's demography. Together, our results provide a detailed characterisation of adaptive mutations in protein-coding genes across S. cerevisiae populations.},

How frequent such mutations occur in evolution and what is the structural and functional context permitting their emergence remain open questions. We built an atlas of intra-protein compensatory substitutions using a phylogenetic approach and a dataset of 1,630 bacterial protein families for which high-quality sequence alignments and experimentally derived protein structures were available. We identified more than 51,000 positions coevolving by the mean of predicted compensatory mutations. Using the evolutionary and structural properties of the analyzed positions, we demonstrate that compensatory mutations are scarce (typically only a few in the protein history) but widespread (the majority of proteins experienced at least one). Typical coevolving residues are evolving slowly, are located in the protein core outside secondary structure motifs, and are more often in contact than expected by chance, even after accounting for their evolutionary rate and solvent exposure. An exception to this general scheme is residues coevolving for charge compensation, which are evolving faster than noncoevolving sites, in contradiction with predictions from simple coevolutionary models, but similar to stem pairs in RNA. While sites with a significant pattern of coevolution by compensatory mutations are rare, the comparative analysis of hundreds of structures ultimately permits a better understanding of the link between the three-dimensional structure of a protein and its fitness landscape.},

Here we extend the sequentially Markovian coalescent model to jointly infer demography and the spatial variation in recombination rate. Using extensive simulations and sequence data from humans, fruit-flies and a fungal pathogen, we demonstrate that iSMC accurately infers recombination maps under a wide range of scenarios–remarkably, even from a single pair of unphased genomes. We exploit this possibility and reconstruct the recombination maps of ancient hominins. We report that the ancient and modern maps are correlated in a manner that reflects the established phylogeny of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern human populations.},

We here report the case of a HE that accidentally integrated into a telomeric region of the nuclear genome of the fungal maize pathogen Ustilago maydis. We show that the gene has a mitochondrial origin, but its original copy is absent from the U. maydis mitochondrial genome, suggesting a subsequent loss or a horizontal transfer from a different species. The telomeric HE underwent mutations in its active site and lost its original start codon. A potential other start codon was retained downstream, but we did not detect any significant transcription of the newly created open reading frame, suggesting that the inserted gene is not functional. Besides, the insertion site is located in a putative RecQ helicase gene, truncating the C-terminal domain of the protein. The truncated helicase is expressed during infection of the host, together with other homologous telomeric helicases. This unusual mutational event altered two genes: The integrated HE gene subsequently lost its homing activity, while its insertion created a truncated version of an existing gene, possibly altering its function. As the insertion is absent in other field isolates, suggesting that it is recent, the U. maydis 521 reference strain offers a snapshot of this singular mutational event.},

Here, we studied the genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity of 22 isolates of the causative agent of the corn smut disease, Ustilago maydis, originating from five locations in Mexico, the presumed center of origin of this species. In this species, many genes encoding secreted effector proteins reside in so-called virulence clusters in the genome, an arrangement that is so far not found in other filamentous plant pathogens. Using a combination of population genomic statistical analyses, we assessed the geographical, historical, and genome-wide variation of genetic diversity in this fungal pathogen. We report evidence of two partially admixed subpopulations that are only loosely associated with geographic origin. Using the multiple sequentially Markov coalescent model, we inferred the demographic history of the two pathogen subpopulations over the last 0.5 Myr. We show that both populations experienced a recent strong bottleneck starting around 10,000 years ago, coinciding with the assumed time of maize domestication. Although the genome average genetic diversity is low compared with other fungal pathogens, we estimated that the rate of nonsynonymous adaptive substitutions is three times higher in genes located within virulence clusters compared with nonclustered genes, including nonclustered effector genes.

Genome analysis of several smut fungi including Ustilago maydis revealed a singular clustered organization of genes encoding secreted effectors. In U. maydis, many of these clusters have a role in virulence. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of clusters of effector genes is difficult because of their intrinsically fast evolution, which erodes the phylogenetic signal and homology relationships. Here, we describe the use of comparative evolutionary analyses of quality draft assemblies of genomes to study the mechanisms of this evolution. We report the genome sequence of a South African isolate of Sporisorium scitamineum, a smut fungus parasitizing sugar cane with a phylogenetic position intermediate to the two previously sequenced species U. maydis and Sporisorium reilianum. We show that the genome of S. scitamineum contains more and larger gene clusters encoding secreted effectors than any previously described species in this group. We trace back the origin of the clusters and find that their evolution is mainly driven by tandem gene duplication. In addition, transposable elements play a major role in the evolution of the clustered genes. Transposable elements are significantly associated with clusters of genes encoding fast evolving secreted effectors. This suggests that such clusters represent a case of genome compartmentalization that restrains the activity of transposable elements on genes under diversifying selection for which this activity is potentially beneficial, while protecting the rest of the genome from its deleterious effect.},

In most species, we identify striking megabase-wide regions, where nucleotide diversity is less than 20\% of the chromosomal average. Such regions are found exclusively on the X chromosome. The regions overlap partially among species, suggesting that the underlying targets are partly shared among species. The regions have higher proportions of singleton SNPs, higher levels of population differentiation, and a higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratio than the rest of the X chromosome. We show that the extent to which diversity is reduced is incompatible with direct selection or the action of background selection and soft selective sweeps alone, and therefore, we suggest that very strong selective sweeps have independently targeted these specific regions in several species. The only genomic feature that we can identify as strongly associated with loss of diversity is the location of testis-expressed ampliconic genes, which also have reduced diversity around them. We hypothesize that these genes may be responsible for selective sweeps in the form of meiotic drive caused by an intragenomic conflict in male meiosis.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is its rapid rate of evolution within and among its various subtypes. Two complementary hypotheses are suggested to explain the sequence variability among HIV-1 subtypes. The first suggests that the functional constraints at each site remain the same across all subtypes, and the differences among subtypes are a direct reflection of random substitutions, which have occurred during the time elapsed since their divergence. The alternative hypothesis suggests that the functional constraints themselves have evolved, and thus sequence differences among subtypes in some sites reflect shifts in function. To determine the contribution of each of these two alternatives to HIV-1 subtype evolution, we have developed a novel Bayesian method for testing and detecting site-specific rate shifts. The RAte Shift EstimatoR (RASER) method determines whether or not site-specific functional shifts characterize the evolution of a protein and, if so, points to the specific sites and lineages in which these shifts have most likely occurred. Applying RASER to a dataset composed of large samples of HIV-1 sequences from different group M subtypes, we reveal rampant evolutionary shifts throughout the HIV-1 proteome. Most of these rate shifts have occurred during the divergence of the major subtypes, establishing that subtype divergence occurred together with functional diversification. We report further evidence for the emergence of a new sub-subtype, characterized by abundant rate-shifting sites. When focusing on the rate-shifting sites detected, we find that many are associated with known function relating to viral life cycle and drug resistance. Finally, we discuss mechanisms of covariation of rate-shifting sites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative analysis of homologous sequences enables the understanding of evolutionary patterns at the molecular level, unraveling the functional constraints that shaped the underlying genes. Bioinformatic pipelines for comparative sequence analysis typically include procedures for (i) alignment quality assessment and (ii) control of sequence redundancy. An additional, underassessed step is the control of the amount and distribution of missing data in sequence alignments. While the number of sequences available for a given gene typically increases with time, the site-specific coverage of each alignment position remains highly variable because of differences in sequencing and annotation quality, or simply because of biological variation. For any given alignment-based analysis, the selection of sequences thus defines a trade-off between the species representation and the quantity of sites with sufficient coverage to be included in the subsequent analyses.
RESULTS: We introduce an algorithm for the optimization of sequence alignments according to the number of sequences vs. number of sites trade-off. The algorithm uses a guide tree to compute scores for each bipartition of the alignment, allowing the recursive selection of sequence subsets with optimal combinations of sequence and site numbers. By applying our methods to two large data sets of several thousands of gene families, we show that significant site-specific coverage increases can be achieved while controlling for the species representation.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm introduced in this work allows the control of the distribution of missing data in any sequence alignment by removing sequences to increase the number of sites with a defined minimum coverage. We advocate that our missing data optimization procedure in an important step which should be considered in comparative analysis pipelines, together with alignment quality assessment and control of sampled diversity.

We show that background selection can explain at most 10\% of this reduction of diversity in the ancestor. Instead, we show that several strong selective sweeps in the ancestral species can explain it. We also report evidence of population specific sweeps in extant humans that overlap the regions of low diversity in the ancestral species. These regions further correspond to chromosomal sections shown to be devoid of Neanderthal introgression into modern humans. This suggests that the same X-linked regions that undergo selective sweeps are among the first to form reproductive barriers between diverging species.

  abstract = {The analysis of extant sequences shows that molecular evolution has been heterogeneous through time and among lineages. However, for a given sequence alignment, it is often difficult to uncover what factors caused this heterogeneity. In fact, identifying and characterizing heterogeneous patterns of molecular evolution along a phylogenetic tree is very challenging, for lack of appropriate methods. Users either have to a priori define groups of branches along which they believe molecular evolution has been similar or have to allow each branch to have its own pattern of molecular evolution. The first approach assumes prior knowledge that is seldom available, and the second requires estimating an unreasonably large number of parameters. Here we propose a convenient and reliable approach where branches get clustered by their pattern of molecular evolution alone, with no need for prior knowledge about the data set under study. Model selection is achieved in a statistical framework and therefore avoids overparameterization. We rely on substitution mapping for efficiency and present two clustering approaches, depending on whether or not we expect neighbouring branches to share more similar patterns of sequence evolution than distant branches. We validate our method on simulations and test it on four previously published data sets. We find that our method correctly groups branches sharing similar equilibrium GC contents in a data set of ribosomal RNAs and recovers expected footprints of selection through dN/dS. Importantly, it also uncovers a new pattern of relaxed selection in a phylogeny of Mantellid frogs, which we are able to correlate to life-history traits. This shows that our programs should be very useful to study patterns of molecular evolution and reveal new correlations between sequence and species evolution.

Here we investigate an alternative methodological option based on probabilistic substitution mapping. The idea is to first reconstruct the substitutional history of each site of an alignment under a homogeneous model of sequence evolution, then to characterize variations in the substitution process across lineages based on substitution counts. Using simulated and published datasets, we demonstrate that probabilistic substitution mapping is robust in that it typically provides accurate reconstruction of sequence ancestry even when the true process is heterogeneous, but a homogeneous model is adopted. Consequently, we show that the new approach is essentially as efficient as and extremely faster than (up to 25 000 times) existing methods, thus paving the way for a systematic survey of substitution process heterogeneity across genes and lineages.},

A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Accurately modeling the sequence substitution process is required for the correct estimation of evolutionary parameters, be they phylogenetic relationships, substitution rates or ancestral states; it is also crucial to simulate realistic data sets. Such simulation procedures are needed to estimate the null-distribution of complex statistics, an approach referred to as parametric bootstrapping, and are also used to test the quality of phylogenetic reconstruction programs. It has often been observed that homologous sequences can vary widely in their nucleotide or amino-acid compositions, revealing that sequence evolution has changed importantly among lineages, and may therefore be most appropriately approached through non-homogeneous models. Several programs implementing such models have been developed, but they are limited in their possibilities: only a few particular models are available for likelihood optimization, and data sets cannot be easily generated using the resulting estimated parameters.


RESULTS

We hereby present a general implementation of non-homogeneous models of substitutions. It is available as dedicated classes in the Bio++ libraries and can hence be used in any C++ program. Two programs that use these classes are also presented. The first one, Bio++ Maximum Likelihood (BppML), estimates parameters of any non-homogeneous model and the second one, Bio++ Sequence Generator (BppSeqGen), simulates the evolution of sequences from these models. These programs allow the user to describe non-homogeneous models through a property file with a simple yet powerful syntax, without any programming required.


CONCLUSION

We show that the general implementation introduced here can accommodate virtually any type of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, including heterotachous ones, while being computer efficient. We furthermore illustrate the use of such general models for parametric bootstrapping, using tests of non-homogeneity applied to an already published ribosomal RNA data set.},

Forty percent of all fixed nonsynonymous substitutions, on the other hand, are driven by positive selection. Adaptive evolution has affected M. graminicola to the highest extent, consistent with recent host specialization. Positive selection has prominently altered genes encoding secreted proteins and putative pathogen effectors supporting the premise that molecular host-pathogen interaction is a strong driver of pathogen evolution. Recent divergence between pathogen sister species is attested by the high degree of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in their genomes. We exploit ILS to generate a genetic map of the species without any crossing data, document recent times of species divergence relative to genome divergence, and show that gene-rich regions or regions with low recombination experience stronger effects of natural selection on neutral diversity. Emergence of a new agricultural host selected a highly specialized and fast-evolving pathogen with unique evolutionary patterns compared with its wild relatives. The strong impact of natural selection, we document, is at odds with the small effective population sizes estimated and suggest that population sizes were historically large but likely unstable.},

A large number of bioinformatics applications in the fields of bio-sequence analysis, molecular evolution and population genetics typically share input/output methods, data storage requirements and data analysis algorithms. Such common features may be conveniently bundled into re-usable libraries, which enable the rapid development of new methods and robust applications.


RESULTS

We present Bio++, a set of Object Oriented libraries written in C++. Available components include classes for data storage and handling (nucleotide/amino-acid/codon sequences, trees, distance matrices, population genetics datasets), various input/output formats, basic sequence manipulation (concatenation, transcription, translation, etc.), phylogenetic analysis (maximum parsimony, markov models, distance methods, likelihood computation and maximization), population genetics/genomics (diversity statistics, neutrality tests, various multi-locus analyses) and various algorithms for numerical calculus.


CONCLUSION

Implementation of methods aims at being both efficient and user-friendly. A special concern was given to the library design to enable easy extension and new methods development. We defined a general hierarchy of classes that allow the developer to implement its own algorithms while remaining compatible with the rest of the libraries.

We find ILS present in ∼1\% of the genome, and that the ancestral species of human and chimpanzees never experienced a severe population bottleneck. The existence of ILS is validated with simulations, site pattern analysis, and analysis of rare genomic events. The existence of ILS allows us to disentangle the time of isolation of humans and orangutans (the speciation time) from the genetic divergence time, and we find speciation to be as recent as 9-13 million years ago (Mya; contingent on the calibration point). The analyses provide further support for a recent speciation of human and chimpanzee at ∼4 Mya and a diverse ancestor of human and chimpanzee with an effective population size of about 50,000 individuals. Posterior decoding infers ILS for each nucleotide in the genome, and we use this to deduce patterns of selection in the ancestral species. We demonstrate the effect of background selection in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. In agreement with predictions from population genetics, ILS was found to be reduced in exons and gene-dense regions when we control for confounding factors such as GC content and recombination rate.

Long regions up to 100 kb without variation alternate with similarly long regions of high variability. The variable segments in the genome alignment are organized into two main haplotype groups that have diverged ∼3\% from each other. The genome patterns in Z. pseudotritici are consistent with a hybrid speciation event resulting from a cross between two divergent haploid individuals. The resulting hybrids formed the new species without backcrossing to the parents. We observe no variation in 54\% of the genome in the five individuals and estimate a complete loss of variation for at least 30\% of the genome in the entire species. A strong population bottleneck following the hybridization event caused this loss of variation. Variable segments in the Z. pseudotritici genome exhibit the two haplotypes contributed by the parental individuals. From our previously estimated recombination map of Z. tritici and the size distribution of variable chromosome blocks untouched by recombination we estimate that the hybridization occurred ∼380 sexual generations ago. We show that the amount of lost variation is explained by genetic drift during the bottleneck and by natural selection, as evidenced by the correlation of presence/absence of variation with gene density and recombination rate. The successful spread of this unique reproductively isolated pathogen highlights the strong potential of hybridization in the emergence of pathogen species with sexual reproduction.},

The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We use a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four-species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND

Although the patterns of co-substitutions in RNA is now well characterized, detection of coevolving positions in proteins remains a difficult task. It has been recognized that the signal is typically weak, due to the fact that (i) amino-acid are characterized by various biochemical properties, so that distinct amino acids changes are not functionally equivalent, and (ii) a given mutation can be compensated by more than one mutation, at more than one position.


RESULTS

We present a new method based on phylogenetic substitution mapping. The two above-mentioned problems are addressed by (i) the introduction of a weighted mapping, which accounts for the biochemical effects (volume, polarity, charge) of amino-acid changes, (ii) the use of a clustering approach to detect groups of coevolving sites of virtually any size, and (iii) the distinction between biochemical compensation and other coevolutionary mechanisms. We apply this methodology to a previously studied data set of bacterial ribosomal RNA, and to three protein data sets (myoglobin of vertebrates, S-locus Receptor Kinase and Methionine Amino-Peptidase).


CONCLUSION

We succeed in detecting groups of sites which significantly depart the null hypothesis of independence. Group sizes range from pairs to groups of size approximately 10, depending on the substitution weights used. The structural and functional relevance of these groups of sites are assessed, and the various evolutionary processes potentially generating correlated substitution patterns are discussed.},

Exhibiting such positions with a coevolution pattern from a sequence alignment has great potential for predicting functional and structural properties of molecules through comparative analysis. This task is complicated by the existence of additional correlation sources, leading to false predictions. The nature of the data is a major source of noise correlation: sequences are taken from individuals with different degrees of relatedness, and who therefore are intrinsically correlated. This has led to several method developments in different fields that are potentially confusing for non-expert users interested in these methodologies. It also explains why coevolution detection methods are largely unemployed despite the importance of the biological questions they address. In this article, I focus on the role of shared ancestry for understanding molecular coevolution patterns. I review and classify existing coevolution detection methods according to their ability to handle shared ancestry. Using a ribosomal RNA benchmark data set, for which detailed knowledge of the structure and coevolution patterns is available, I demonstrate and explain why taking the underlying evolutionary history of sequences into account is the only way to extract the full coevolution signal in the data. I also evaluate, using rigorous statistical procedures, the best approaches to do so, and discuss several important biological aspects to consider when performing coevolution analyses.},

For population genetic inference we have sequenced many loci, but only in a few individuals. We present a new method that allows inference of the divergence process based on two closely related genomes, modelled as gradual isolation in an isolation with migration model. This allows estimation of the initial time of restricted gene flow, the cessation of gene flow, as well as the population sizes, migration rates, and recombination rates. We show by simulations that the parameter estimation is accurate with genome-wide data and use the model to disentangle the divergence processes among three sets of closely related great ape species: bonobo/chimpanzee, eastern/western gorillas, and Sumatran/Bornean orang-utans. We find allopatric speciation for bonobo and chimpanzee and non-allopatric speciation for the gorillas and orang-utans. We also consider the split between humans and chimpanzees/bonobos and find evidence for non-allopatric speciation, similar to that within gorillas and orang-utans.},

  abstract = {Due to genetic variation in the ancestor of two populations or two species, the divergence time for DNA sequences from two populations is variable along the genome. Within genomic segments all bases will share the same divergence-because they share a most recent common ancestor-when no recombination event has occurred to split them apart. The size of these segments of constant divergence depends on the recombination rate, but also on the speciation time, the effective population size of the ancestral population, as well as demographic effects and selection. Thus, inference of these parameters may be possible if we can decode the divergence times along a genomic alignment. Here, we present a new hidden Markov model that infers the changing divergence (coalescence) times along the genome alignment using a coalescent framework, in order to estimate the speciation time, the recombination rate, and the ancestral effective population size. The model is efficient enough to allow inference on whole-genome data sets. We first investigate the power and consistency of the model with coalescent simulations and then apply it to the whole-genome sequences of the two orangutan sub-species, Bornean (P. p. pygmaeus) and Sumatran (P. p. abelii) orangutans from the Orangutan Genome Project. We estimate the speciation time between the two sub-species to be thousand years ago and the effective population size of the ancestral orangutan species to be , consistent with recent results based on smaller data sets. We also report a negative correlation between chromosome size and ancestral effective population size, which we interpret as a signature of recombination increasing the efficacy of selection.},

  abstract = {It has long been accepted that the structural constraints stemming from the 3D structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) lead to coevolution through compensating mutations between interacting sites. State-of-the-art methods for detecting coevolving sites, however, while reaching high levels of specificity and sensitivity for Watson-Crick (WC) pairs of the helices defining the secondary structure, only scarcely reveal tertiary interactions occurring at the level of the 3D structure. In order to understand the relative failure of coevolutionary methods to detect such interactions, we analyze 2,682 interacting sites derived from high-resolution structures, which include a comprehensive data set of rRNA sequences from Archaea and Bacteria. We report a striking difference in the amount of coevolution between WC and non-WC pairs. In order to understand this pattern, we derive fitness landscapes from the geometry of base pairing interactions and construct neutral networks of substitutions for each type of interaction. These networks show that coevolution is a property of WC pairs because, unlike non-WC pairs, their landscapes exhibit fitness valleys, a single mutation in a WC pair resulting in a fitness drop. Second, we used the inferred neutral networks to estimate the level of constraint acting on each type of base pair and show that it correlates negatively with the observed rate of substitutions for all non-WC pairs. WC pairs appear as outliers, fixing more substitutions than expected according to their level of constraint. We here propose that the rate of substitution in WC pairs is due to coevolution resulting from constraints acting at intermediate levels of organization, namely the one of the helical stem with its forming WC pairs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report a significant excess of intrahelical, inter-WC pairs coevolution compared with interhelices pairs. Altogether, these results show that detailed biochemical knowledge is required and has to be incorporated into evolutionary reasoning in order to understand the fine patterns of variation at the molecular level. They also demonstrate that coevolutionary analysis provides almost exclusively 2D information and only little 3D signal.},

It results that the evolutionary rate of a given position in an alignment is a function of the level of constraint acting on this position. Inferring evolutionary rates from a set of aligned sequences is hence a powerful method to detect functionally and/or structurally important positions in a protein. Some positions, however, may be constrained while having a high substitution rate, providing these substitutions do not affect the biochemical property under constraint. Here, I introduce a new evolutionary rate measure accounting for the evolution of specific biochemical properties (e.g., volume, polarity, and charge). I then present a new statistical method based on the comparison of two rate measures: a site is said to be constrained for property X if it shows an unexpectedly high conservation of X knowing its total evolutionary rate. Compared to single-rate methods, the two-rate method offers several advantages: it (i) allows assessment of the significance of the constraint, (ii) provides information on the type of constraint acting on each position, and (iii) detects positions that are not proposed by previous methods. I apply this method to a 200-sequence data set of triosephosphate isomerase and report significant cases of positions constrained for polarity, volume, or charge. The three-dimensional localization of these positions shows that they are of potential interest to the molecular evolutionist and to the biochemist.},

Genomic data offer a new opportunity to estimate ancestral character states, through (i) the correlation between DNA evolutionary processes and species life-history traits and (ii) available reliable methods for ancestral sequence inference. Here, we assess the relevance of mitochondrial DNA--the most popular molecular marker in animals--as a predictor of ancestral life-history traits in mammals, using the order of Cetartiodactyla as a benchmark. Using the complete set of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, we show that the lineage-specific nonsynonymous over synonymous substitution rate ratio (dN/dS) is closely correlated with the species body mass, longevity and age of sexual maturity in Cetartiodactyla and can be used as a marker of ancestral traits provided that the noise introduced by short branches is appropriately dealt with. Based on ancestral dN/dS estimates, we predict that the first cetartiodactyls were relatively small animals (around 20 kg). This finding is in accordance with Cope's rule and the fossil record but could not be recovered via continuous character evolution methods.},

Here we demonstrate how a fine-scale recombination map can be derived for the ancestor of human and chimpanzee, allowing us to study the changes that have occurred in human and chimpanzee since these species diverged. The map is produced from more than one million accurately determined recombination events. We find that this new recombination map is intermediate to the maps of human and chimpanzee but that the recombination landscape has evolved more rapidly in the human lineage than in the chimpanzee lineage. We use the map to show that recombination rate, through the effect of GC-biased gene conversion, is an even stronger determinant of base composition evolution than previously reported.},

	abstract = {'Orang-utan' is derived from a Malay term meaning 'man of the forest' and aptly describes the southeast Asian great apes native to Sumatra and Borneo. The orang-utan species, Pongo abelii (Sumatran) and Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean), are the most phylogenetically distant great apes from humans, thereby providing an informative perspective on hominid evolution. Here we present a Sumatran orang-utan draft genome assembly and short read sequence data from five Sumatran and five Bornean orang-utan genomes. Our analyses reveal that, compared to other primates, the orang-utan genome has many unique features. Structural evolution of the orang-utan genome has proceeded much more slowly than other great apes, evidenced by fewer rearrangements, less segmental duplication, a lower rate of gene family turnover and surprisingly quiescent Alu repeats, which have played a major role in restructuring other primate genomes. We also describe a primate polymorphic neocentromere, found in both Pongo species, emphasizing the gradual evolution of orang-utan genome structure. Orang-utans have extremely low energy usage for a eutherian mammal, far lower than their hominid relatives. Adding their genome to the repertoire of sequenced primates illuminates new signals of positive selection in several pathways including glycolipid metabolism. From the population perspective, both Pongo species are deeply diverse; however, Sumatran individuals possess greater diversity than their Bornean counterparts, and more species-specific variation. Our estimate of Bornean/Sumatran speciation time, 400,000 years ago, is more recent than most previous studies and underscores the complexity of the orang-utan speciation process. Despite a smaller modern census population size, the Sumatran effective population size (N(e)) expanded exponentially relative to the ancestral N(e) after the split, while Bornean N(e) declined over the same period. Overall, the resources and analyses presented here offer new opportunities in evolutionary genomics, insights into hominid biology, and an extensive database of variation for conservation efforts.},

Consequently, the inherent stochasticity of binding and diffusion processes generates noise along the cascade that leads to the synthesis of a protein from its encoding gene. As a result, isogenic cell populations display phenotypic variability even in homogeneous environments. The extent and consequences of this stochastic gene expression have only recently been assessed on a genome-wide scale, owing, in particular, to the advent of single-cell transcriptomics. However, the evolutionary forces shaping this stochasticity have yet to be unraveled. Here, we take advantage of two recently published data sets for the single-cell transcriptome of the domestic mouse Mus musculus to characterize the effect of natural selection on gene-specific transcriptional stochasticity. We show that noise levels in the mRNA distributions (also known as transcriptional noise) significantly correlate with three-dimensional nuclear domain organization, evolutionary constraints on the encoded protein, and gene age. However, the position of the encoded protein in a biological pathway is the main factor that explains observed levels of transcriptional noise, in agreement with models of noise propagation within gene networks. Because transcriptional noise is under widespread selection, we argue that it constitutes an important component of the phenotype and that variance of expression is a potential target of adaptation. Stochastic gene expression should therefore be considered together with the mean expression level in functional and evolutionary studies of gene expression.},

Because all loci in a genome are not independent, this evolution of data sets is mirrored by a methodological change. The evolutionary processes that generate the observed sequences are now modeled spatially along genomes whereas it was previously described temporally (either in a forward or backward manner). Although the spatial process of sequence evolution is complex, approximations to the model feature Markovian properties, permitting efficient inference. In this chapter, we introduce these recent developments that enable the modeling of the evolutionary history of a sample of several individual genomes. Such models assume the occurrence of meiotic recombination, and therefore, to date, they are dedicated to the analysis of eukaryotic species.},

These ecological interactions result in coevolution between genes belonging to different partners. A well-understood example is secreted fungal effector proteins and their host targets, which play an important role in pathogenic interactions. Biotrophic smut fungi (Basidiomycota) are well-suited to investigate the evolution of plant pathogens, because several reference genomes and genetic tools are available for these species. Here, we used the genomes of Sporisorium reilianum f. sp. zeae and S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum, two closely related formae speciales infecting maize and sorghum, respectively, together with the genomes of Ustilago hordei, Ustilago maydis, and Sporisorium scitamineum to identify and characterize genes displaying signatures of positive selection. We identified 154 gene families having undergone positive selection during species divergence in at least one lineage, among which 77\% were identified in the two investigated formae speciales of S. reilianum. Remarkably, only 29\% of positively selected genes encode predicted secreted proteins. We assessed the contribution to virulence of nine of these candidate effector genes in S. reilianum f. sp. zeae by deleting individual genes, including a homologue of the effector gene pit2 previously characterized in U. maydis. Only the pit2 deletion mutant was found to be strongly reduced in virulence. Additional experiments are required to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the selection forces acting on the other candidate effector genes, as well as the large fraction of positively selected genes encoding predicted cytoplasmic proteins.},

This mapping takes into account the uncertainty over ancestral states and among-site rate variation. We then build, for each site, a "substitution vector" containing the posterior estimates of the number of substitutions in each branch. The amount of coevolution for a pair of sites is then measured as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two corresponding substitution vectors and compared to the expectation under the null hypothesis of independence. We applied the method to a 79-species bacterial ribosomal RNA data set, for which extensive structural characterization has been done over the last 30 years.

Hallmarks of the disease are large tumors that develop on all aerial parts of the host in which dark pigmented teliospores are formed. We have identified a member of the WOPR family of transcription factors, Ros1, as major regulator of spore formation in U. maydis. ros1 expression is induced only late during infection and hence Ros1 is neither involved in plant colonization of dikaryotic fungal hyphae nor in plant tumor formation. However, during late stages of infection Ros1 is essential for fungal karyogamy, massive proliferation of diploid fungal cells and spore formation. Premature expression of ros1 revealed that Ros1 counteracts the b-dependent filamentation program and induces morphological alterations resembling the early steps of sporogenesis. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq analyses uncovered that Ros1 remodels expression of about 30\% of all U. maydis genes with 40\% of these being direct targets. In total the expression of 80 transcription factor genes is controlled by Ros1. Four of the upregulated transcription factor genes were deleted and two of the mutants were affected in spore development. A large number of b-dependent genes were differentially regulated by Ros1, suggesting substantial changes in this regulatory cascade that controls filamentation and pathogenic development. Interestingly, 128 genes encoding secreted effectors involved in the establishment of biotrophic development were downregulated by Ros1 while a set of 70 "late effectors" was upregulated. These results indicate that Ros1 is a master regulator of late development in U. maydis and show that the biotrophic interaction during sporogenesis involves a drastic shift in expression of the fungal effectome including the downregulation of effectors that are essential during early stages of infection.},

The genomes of individuals from the same population can exhibit different numbers of chromosomes and different organisation of chromosomal segments, defining so-called accessory compartments that have been shown to be crucial to pathogenicity in plant-infecting fungi. This high level of structural variation confers a methodological challenge for population genomic analyses. Variant discovery from population sequencing data is typically achieved using established pipelines based on the mapping of short reads to a reference genome. These pipelines have been developed, and extensively used, for eukaryote genomes of both plants and animals, to retrieve single nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions and deletions. However, they do not permit the inference of large-scale genomic structural variation, as this task typically requires the alignment of complete genome sequences. Here we compare traditional variant discovery approaches to a pipeline based on de novo genome assembly of short read data followed by whole genome alignment, using simulated data sets with properties mimicking that of fungal pathogen genomes. We show that the latter approach exhibits levels of performance comparable to that of read-mapping based methodologies, when used on sequence data with sufficient coverage. We argue that this approach further allows additional types of genomic diversity to be explored, in particular as long-read third-generation sequencing technologies are becoming increasingly available to generate population genomic data.},

Recent developments in population genomics allow inferring rates of adaptive mutations by fitting a distribution of fitness effects to the observed patterns of polymorphism and divergence at sites under selection and sites assumed to evolve neutrally. Here, we summarize the current state-of-the-art of these methods and review the factors that affect the molecular rate of adaptation. Several studies have reported extensive cross-species variation in the proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitutions (α) and predicted that species with larger effective population sizes undergo less genetic drift and higher rates of adaptation. Disentangling the rates of positive and negative selection, however, revealed that mutations with deleterious effects are the main driver of this population size effect and that adaptive substitution rates vary comparatively little across species. Conversely, rates of adaptive substitution have been documented to vary substantially within genomes. On a genome-wide scale, gene density, recombination and mutation rate were observed to play a role in shaping molecular rates of adaptation, as predicted under models of linked selection. At the gene level, it has been reported that the gene functional category and the macromolecular structure substantially impact the rate of adaptive mutations. Here, we deliver a comprehensive review of methods used to infer the molecular adaptive rate, the potential drivers of adaptive evolution and how positive selection shapes molecular evolution within genes, across genes within species and between species.},

To address this, we analyzed the impact of protein architecture on the rate of adaptive substitutions, aiming to understand how protein biophysics influences fitness and adaptation. Using Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana population genomics data, we fitted models of distribution of fitness effects and estimated the rate of adaptive amino-acid substitutions both at the protein and amino-acid residue level. We performed a comprehensive analysis covering genome, gene, and protein structure, by exploring a multitude of factors with a plausible impact on the rate of adaptive evolution, such as intron number, protein length, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, intrinsic protein disorder, chaperone affinity, gene expression, protein function, and protein-protein interactions. We found that the relative solvent accessibility is a major determinant of adaptive evolution, with most adaptive mutations occurring at the surface of proteins. Moreover, we observe that the rate of adaptive substitutions differs between protein functional classes, with genes encoding for protein biosynthesis and degradation signaling exhibiting the fastest rates of protein adaptation. Overall, our results suggest that adaptive evolution in proteins is mainly driven by intermolecular interactions, with host-pathogen coevolution likely playing a major role.},

Antagonistic host-pathogen coevolution is thought to be a major driver of genome evolution between interacting species. While rapid evolution of pathogens has been documented in several model organisms, the genetic mechanisms of their adaptation are still poorly understood and debated, particularly the role of sexual reproduction. Here, we apply a population genomic approach to infer genome-wide patterns of selection among 13 isolates of Zymoseptoria tritici, a fungal pathogen characterized by extremely high genetic diversity, gene density, and recombination rates. We report that the genome of Z. tritici undergoes a high rate of adaptive substitutions, with 44\% of nonsynonymous substitutions being adaptive on average. This fraction reaches 68\% in so-called effector genes encoding determinants of pathogenicity, and the distribution of fitness effects differs in this class of genes as they undergo adaptive mutations with stronger positive fitness effects, but also more slightly deleterious mutations. Besides the globally high rate of adaptive substitutions, we report a negative relationship between pN/pS and the fine-scale recombination rate and a strong positive correlation between the rate of adaptive nonsynonymous substitutions (ωa) and recombination rate. This result suggests a pervasive role of both background selection and Hill-Robertson interference even in a species with an exceptionally high recombination rate (60 cM/Mb on average). While transposable elements (TEs) have been suggested to contribute to adaptation by creating compartments of fast-evolving genomic regions, we do not find a significant effect of TEs on the rate of adaptive mutations. Overall our study suggests that sexual recombination is a significant driver of genome evolution, even in rapidly evolving organisms subject to recurrent mutations with large positive effects.},

It determines the extent of linkage disequilibrium along the genome and, thereby, the efficacy of both purifying and positive selection. The population recombination rate can be inferred using models of genome evolution in populations. Classic methods based on the patterns of linkage disequilibrium provide the most accurate estimates, providing large sample sizes are used and the demography of the population is properly accounted for. Here, the capacity of approaches based on the sequentially Markov coalescent (SMC) to infer the genome-average recombination rate from as little as a single diploid genome is examined. SMC approaches provide highly accurate estimates even in the presence of changing population sizes, providing that (1) within genome heterogeneity is accounted for and (2) classic maximum-likelihood optimization algorithms are employed to fit the model. SMC-based estimates proved sensitive to gene conversion, leading to an overestimation of the recombination rate if conversion events are frequent. Conversely, methods based on the correlation of heterozygosity succeed in disentangling the rate of crossing over from that of gene conversion events, but only when the population size is constant and the recombination landscape homogeneous. These results call for a convergence of these two methods to obtain accurate and comparable estimates of recombination rates between populations.},

  abstract        = {Comparative sequence analysis permits unraveling the molecular processes underlying gene evolution. Many statistical methods generate candidate positions within genes, such as fast or slowly evolving sites, coevolving groups of residues, sites undergoing positive selection, or changes in evolutionary rates. Understanding the functional causes of these evolutionary patterns requires combining the results of these analyses and mapping them onto molecular structures, a complex task involving distinct coordinate referential systems. To ease this task, we introduce the site/group extended data format, a simple text format to store (groups of) site annotations. We developed a toolset, the SgedTools, which permits site/group extended data file manipulation, creating them from various software outputs and translating coordinates between individual sequences, alignments, and three-dimensional structures. The package also includes a Monte-Carlo procedure to generate random site samples, possibly conditioning on site-specific features. This eases the statistical testing of evolutionary hypotheses, accounting for the structural properties of the encoded molecules.},

In this work, we investigate the frequencies and determinants of ILS in 29 major ancestral nodes across the entire primate phylogeny. We find up to 64% of the genome affected by ILS at individual nodes. We exploit ILS to reconstruct speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Estimated speciation times are much more recent than genomic divergence times and are in good agreement with the fossil record. We show extensive variation of ILS along the genome, mainly driven by recombination but also by the distance to genes, highlighting a major impact of selection on variation along the genome. In many nodes, ILS is reduced more on the X chromosome compared with autosomes than expected under neutrality, which suggests higher impacts of natural selection on the X chromosome. Finally, we show an excess of ILS in genes with immune functions and a deficit of ILS in housekeeping genes. The extensive ILS in primates discovered in this study provides insights into the speciation times, ancestral population sizes, and patterns of natural selection that shape primate evolution.},

We provide evidence for a novel hypothesis that P. destructans emerged from plant-associated fungi and retained invasion strategies affiliated with fungal pathogens of plants. We demonstrate that P. destructans invades bat skin in successive biotrophic and necrotrophic stages (hemibiotrophic infection), a mechanism previously only described in plant fungal pathogens. Further, the convergence of hyphae at hair follicles suggests nutrient tropism. Tropism, biotrophy, and necrotrophy are often associated with structures termed appressoria in plant fungal pathogens; the penetrating hyphae produced by P. destructans resemble appressoria. Finally, we conducted a phylogenomic analysis of a taxonomically diverse collection of fungi. Despite gaps in genetic sampling of prehistoric and contemporary fungal species, we estimate an 88% probability the ancestral state of the clade containing P. destructans was a plant-associated fungus.},

Identifying the primary magnetosensor remains a fundamental open question. Cryptochromes (Cry) have been shown to be magnetically sensitive, and Cry4a from a migratory songbird seems to show enhanced magnetic sensitivity in vitro compared to Cry4a from resident species. We investigate Cry and their potential involvement in magnetoreception in a phylogenetic framework, integrating molecular evolutionary analyses with protein dynamics modelling. Our analysis is based on 363 bird genomes and identifies different selection regimes in passerines. We show that Cry4a is characterized by strong positive selection and high variability, typical characteristics of sensor proteins. We identify key sites that are likely to have facilitated the evolution of an optimized sensory protein for night-time orientation in songbirds. Additionally, we show that Cry4 was lost in hummingbirds, parrots and Tyranni (Suboscines), and thus identified a gene deletion, which might facilitate testing the function of Cry4a in birds. In contrast, the other avian Cry (Cry1 and Cry2) were highly conserved across all species, indicating basal, non-sensory functions. Our results support a specialization or functional differentiation of Cry4 in songbirds which could be magnetosensation.},

While expression analysis and knockout experiments can provide insights into the function, they do not directly test whether the gene is beneficial for its carrier. Here, we have used a seminatural environment experiment to test the fitness of the previously identified de novo evolved mouse gene Pldi, which has been implicated to have a role in sperm differentiation. We used a knockout mouse strain for this gene and competed it against its parental wildtype strain for several generations of free reproduction. We found that the knockout (ko) allele frequency decreased consistently across three replicates of the experiment. Using an approximate Bayesian computation framework that simulated the data under a demographic scenario mimicking the experiment's demography, we could estimate a selection coefficient ranging between 0.21 and 0.61 for the wildtype allele compared to the ko allele in males, under various models. This implies a relatively strong selective advantage, which would fix the new gene in less than hundred generations after its emergence.},

  abstract        = {Recombination is responsible for breaking up haplotypes, influencing genetic variability, and the efficacy of selection. Bird genomes lack the protein PR domain-containing protein 9, a key determinant of recombination dynamics in most metazoans. Historical recombination maps in birds show an apparent stasis in positioning recombination events. This highly conserved recombination pattern over long timescales may constrain the evolution of recombination in birds. At the same time, extensive variation in recombination rate is observed across the genome and between different species of birds. Here, we characterize the fine-scale historical recombination map of an iconic migratory songbird, the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), using a linkage disequilibrium-based approach that accounts for population demography. Our results reveal variable recombination rates among and within chromosomes, which associate positively with nucleotide diversity and GC content and negatively with chromosome size. Recombination rates increased significantly at regulatory regions but not necessarily at gene bodies. CpG islands are associated strongly with recombination rates, though their specific position and local DNA methylation patterns likely influence this relationship. The association with retrotransposons varied according to specific family and location. Our results also provide evidence of heterogeneous intrachromosomal conservation of recombination maps between the blackcap and its closest sister taxon, the garden warbler. These findings highlight the considerable variability of recombination rates at different scales and the role of specific genomic features in shaping this variation. This study opens the possibility of further investigating the impact of recombination on specific population-genomic features.},

In the green plant lineage, it is composed of two large (LSU) and two small (SSU) sub-units encoded by paralogous genes, as a consequence of several rounds of duplication. First, our aim was to detect specific patterns of molecular evolution following duplication events and the divergence between monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Secondly, we investigated coevolution between amino acids both within and between sub-units. A phylogeny of each AGPase sub-unit was built using all gymnosperm and angiosperm sequences available in databases. Accelerated evolution along specific branches was tested using the ratio of the non-synonymous to the synonymous substitution rate. Coevolution between amino acids was investigated taking into account compensatory changes between co-substitutions. We showed that SSU paralogues evolved under high functional constraints during angiosperm radiation, with a significant level of coevolution between amino acids that participate in SSU major functions. In contrast, in the LSU paralogues, we identified residues under positive selection (1) following the first LSU duplication that gave rise to two paralogues mainly expressed in angiosperm source and sink tissues, respectively; and (2) following the emergence of grass-specific paralogues expressed in the endosperm. Finally, we found coevolution between residues that belong to the interaction domains of both sub-units. Our results support the view that coevolution among amino acid residues, especially those lying in the interaction domain of each sub-unit, played an important role in AGPase evolution. First, within SSU, coevolution allowed compensating mutations in a highly constrained context. Secondly, the LSU paralogues probably acquired tissue-specific expression and regulatory properties via the coevolution between sub-unit interacting domains. Finally, the pattern we observed during LSU evolution is consistent with repeated sub-functionalization under 'Escape from Adaptive Conflict', a model rarely illustrated in the literature.},

	abstract = {Asserting which allele is ancestral or derived, known as polarisation, is a prerequisite of many population and quantitative genetic methods. One important application is the inference of the unfolded site-frequency spectrum (uSFS). The most widely used approaches are based on outgroup data. However, for studies on species with only distantly related outgroups, large divergence between the ingroup and outgroup can result in alignment difficulties and substantial missing data, causing many sites of interest to be lost. Here, we present PolarBEAR (Polarisation By Estimation of the Ancestral Recombination graph), a method that uses the local genealogies from the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) to infer ancestral states. We show that PolarBEAR reaches high accuracy in polarisation and uSFS estimation using simulations under several scenarios. This accuracy, however, heavily depends on the ARG reconstruction method employed. We also applied our method to human population data and compared it with the outgroup-based method est-sfs. Although PolarBEAR could not infer the ancestral state with high confidence at certain positions, it obtained results for positions that est-sfs could not polarise due to missing outgroup data. The polarisation results of the two methods were highly consistent at positions inferred by both methods. The two methods inferred similar uSFS, with PolarBEAR estimating slightly fewer high-frequency derived alleles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PolarBEAR is robust across different mutation models in our simulations, while est-sfs exhibits a bias in the presence of heterogeneous base composition. PolarBEAR can complement outgroup-based methods, or replace them when no appropriate outgroup sequence is available.},
